For my Sinatra project, I created a web app called Activity Generator that randomizes events/activities for local New Yorkers. Personally, I always have difficulty finding new spots to hang out at and explore even though NYC has so much to offer. This project is geared towards indecisive people like me. When users sign up for Activity Generator, they get access to events that locals have recommended. It will randomize a place for you to visit and there is also an option to see all activities available on the app which have been separated by categories. Each user is free to recommend a new activity if they want and post it for others to see. There is also an option for users to comment on each activity to give a better perspective on whether that specific activity would be a fit for you. 

I had a bit of difficulty on this project in the very beginning. I wasn't sure how to set up my Gemfile and file structure on what I would need. As a result, I had to continuously add on files and gems as I was programming when I realized that a certain functionality wasn't build in vanilla Ruby. This was a good learning experience as well since labs already have everything set up for you. Sometimes I do not give the other files the attention it needs and I only focus on writing code so it passes all the tests. I know this is something I'll need to pay more attention to going forward. 

On a completely separate note, I managed to work in a group for the Fwitter Project and found it super fun. It really was a great learning experience because working in a pair was very efficient and it was nice to be able to discuss with others how to build out each function rather than handling it all on my own.
