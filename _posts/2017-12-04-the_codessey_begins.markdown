"Why?"

Anyone who has known me from age 3 and up knew that that was my favorite word. I was an exceedingly curious child growing up. Why did blue and yellow make green? How does Santa come down a chimney (mind that my childhood home had no chimney either)? I loved to dig in to find out how or why things were the way they were. 

Flashforward some years and I'm studying accounting at Baruch College with a few tax internships available on my resume. It was during my penultimate year that I realized my passion wasn't with tax. With only one year left before graduation, I was not sure if it was a better choice to stay and finish up the rest of my account degree or switch out and consider a whole new concentration. It took a lot of self-reflection but I realized that my minor courses (I was aiming for a Computer Information Systems minor at the time) such as Database Management, Web Design and OOP with C++ were some of my favorite and most stimulating classes in college. With that, I made the jump off the accounting ship.  

With my limited work experience in tech, I managed to land my first full-time job as a Computer Programmer Analyst at The Department of Social Services. The job didn't include any developing or writing code. For the most part, my day-to-day functions included providing support for a variety of different internally developed applications, testing them on different platforms and documenting end-user issues, etc. I can honestly say I really enjoyed the testing portion. While my job function only required reporting errors, I found myself truly intrigued on how it worked. Why do certain errors occur on iOS but not on Windows? Why did the current version update cause discrepancies between the mobile and desktop app? More often than not, I found myself peering over the developers' shoulder while they were working. What does that modified block of code do? How will that affect the user interface?

It was after a little more than a year on the job that got me thinking: could I see myself transitioning from a support role to a developer role? I had dinner with a friend who was a recent graduate of Flatiron School and she asked me if I was so interested in how code runs, why didn't I just learn it myself? That led me here: enrolling in Flatiron School's Online Web Developer Program. I cannot even express how excited I am to begin this journey and become a part of an innovative and inquisitive community that thrives on building new solutions to all sorts of problems. 

Hello World! Phoebe will ask a lot of questions.
