This is the first project I've taken on and to be honest, I was pretty worried at first. So far, the labs and lessons I've learned and went through only consisted of parts and portions of writing a code. However, with this project everything was to be built and encompassed by everything I learned to date. Part of me reacted with a "Yikes, time to re-read everything" but I was also excited to evaluate how much I learned and retained. With a mixed mentality, I started my assignment. Since this was likely going to be a long haul assignment, I decided to mix it in with information I would never be bored of.  I really enjoy watching movies and going to theaters so for my CLI Data Gem Project, I decided to create an app that would list the 100 highest grossing movies of all time.  

I found a [website](http://https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/all-time) that listed movies ranked by their box office sales. The user would first receive a list of movies and then have the option to learn more about each movie. Each movie would have information such as the year it was released, the production cost, the box office sales, the MPAA rating, and genre. I considered also putting in the cast list but scrapped that idea as big production movies have hundreds of cast members and I wasn't sure people would be interested in who played lackey 2 in a certain high school movie. I considered only offering the main cast actors but that was put on the back burner tentatively. That may possibly be put into a version 2. 

Needless to say, pry was my best friend throughout the assignment. After several lines of code, I would run pry and see if everything was in fact playing out as I expected it to. At first, I was weary of the assignment requirement to commit often. Normally with labs I would just finish them in one sitting and since I wasn't collaborating with anyone else I didn't feel the need to commit and comment on every step. However, I do realize that good practice probably calls for more commits because in a work environment I would assume documentation of everything is key. This actually did prep me to fix my bad habit of that which is super helpful. 

I wasn't a fan of having to record myself coding. I see why it is helpful and it was definitely a good idea to make it an assignment requirement. When you verbalize your thought process, it adds an extra layer of understanding and sometimes I realized talking outloud actually helped me recall certain concepts better. This would also be useful during interviews to be able to explain myself. While I can see and list all the benefits of this component, it doesn't change the fact that I don't like hearing my voice and sometimes I was more concerned with what I was trying to say than focusing completely on coding. I ended up mumbling and rambling a lot so that made me appreciate all the videos posted on Learn even more. Instructors, you are all great! 

While I do have my bare project done, I am now onto refactoring and making my app run smoother. Fingers crossed for the evaluation though!
